<h1>JavaScript - Warm Up</h1>

<p>
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:
<ul>
	* Scripting (same as we did with Python)
	- Web front-end
</ul>
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. 
After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
