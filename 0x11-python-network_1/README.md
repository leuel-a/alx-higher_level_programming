In this project, I will be mainly working with how to fetch URLs using the `urllib` and `requests` module.

`urllib.request` is a Python module for fetching **URL**s (Uniform Resource Locators). It offers a very simple interface,
in the form of the `urlopen` function. This is capable of fetching **URL**s using a variety of different protocols. It
also offers a slightly more complex interface for handling common situations - like basic authentication, cookies,
proxies and so on. These are provided by objects called handlers and openers.

The `requests` library is the de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making
requests behind a beautiful, simple API so that you can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in your application.
`requests` allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. Thereâ€™s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs,
or to form-encode your POST data.
