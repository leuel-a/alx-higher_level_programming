<p> Python is more flexible than C when it comes to control statements. Perhaps the
most well-known statement is the if-statement </p>

<pre>
if {condition}:
	statements to execute if condition is true
elif {condition}:
	statements to execute if condition is true
elif {condition}:
	statements to execute if condition is true
.
.
.

else:
	default condition to be executed if no condition is met
</pre>

<p> There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’
 is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif …
 sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages. </p>
